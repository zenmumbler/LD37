ROOM
----

Floor grouped tiled with slight height differences
Glow spheres: clustered into 3-5 groups for render groups, lights are added separately
	intensity oscillates per group

Ceiling like floor but with much larger height variation: baseColour variations?
	some lights on the ceiling
	some pillars extend all the way through the floor

Movement: simple 2D collision map, circle for player
	construct map from floor creation
	place colliders such that we don't have > 1 collision at a time

Bunch of coloured lights circling around for height-map wall effects



IDEAS
-----

Witty text

One _Special_ Room?

SH / RE style puzzles?
	find the thing(s) that act(s) as a (combined) key
	obscure text / number puzzles

Room Escape
	jiggle the bits to find stuff to get to the exit

Cube
	each room is the same except for some minor differences
	a maze essentially
	lends itself well to ProcGen

Groundhog day
	The room / space is always the same but your actions determine outcome, repeat until you get it right
	prevent series of bad things from happening
	make good things happen
	timed
	many deaths
	combine with ridic puzzles
	frantic or more exploratory?
		frantic requires much scripting, good interaction
		exploratory needs some nudges to keep things going
	hint system, character speaking ala UC
	needs to be rel. short because of repetition, which is good

Car (crash)?
	dream thing ala SH1
	car escape :)
	bleh

Basically "The Room"
	it sold plenty so must be good
	whole room is the puzzle
	moving parts
	much planning I see
	puzzles
